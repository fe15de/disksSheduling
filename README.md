## Introduction

This project was developed as a part of the coursework for the Operating Systems class. The goal is to understand and visualize the behavior of disk scheduling algorithms, which are essential components of operating systems for efficient disk I/O operations.

## Features

- Simulation of Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF) disk scheduling algorithm.
- Input sequence of disk requests to visualize the disk movement.
- Interactive chart displaying the disk movement pattern.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open index.html in your web browser.
3. Enter the sequence of disk requests into the input field.
4. Click on the "SUBMIT" button to visualize the disk movement based on the SSTF algorithm.

## Disk Scheduling Algorithms

### Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)

The SSTF algorithm selects the request that is closest to the current head position, minimizing seek time. It is designed to reduce the average response time for disk I/O operations.
